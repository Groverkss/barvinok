This is a (partial) reimplementation of latte
(http://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~latte/)
using polylib (http://icps.u-strasbg.fr/polylib/).

Next to polylib, it uses NTL (http://shoup.net/ntl/)

Both NTL and polylib need to have been compiled with gmp
support.
For NTL this means you have to specify
    NTL_GMP_LIP=on

Note that the fractional representation is subject to change.
