The input of the bernstein executable consists of
- the parametric polytope in PolyLib notation
- the context in PolyLib notation
- a list of the names of the variables and the parameters
- the parametric polynomial in GiNac notation

For verification, each of the examples also includes the expected solution,
consisting of the number of domains and for each domain
- the constraints in PolyLib notation
- a list of all corresponding coefficients
- a list of minimal coefficients
- a list of maximal coefficients

Brief description of examples:


basicLinear.matrix			Simple Example with two parameters 
					and a linear Poly to test linear 
					coefficient comparison.
basicLinear.poly			Same as the first, but in 
					testehrhart like format.

basicLinear2.matrix			Similar to the first but with a 
					negative Parameter (Q).

basicTest.matrix			Very simple example taken from a 
					real example from Memory Peak
					problem.

basicTestParameterPosNeg.matrix		Similar to the basic test but the 
					parameter can be negative.

linearExample.matrix			A more complicated linear example
					, with three variables and three 
					parameters.
linearExample.poly			Same as last, but in testehrhart 
					like format.

philippe.matrix				Example from the doc.

philippe3vars.matrix			Example from the doc, with 3 
					variables.

philippe3vars3pars.matrix		Example from the doc, with 3 
					variables and with 3 parameters.

philippeNeg.matrix			Example from the doc, with a 
					negative parameter.

philippePolynomialCoeff.matrix		Example from the doc, modified 
					with polynomial
					(on the parameters) coefficients.

philippePolynomialCoeff1P.matrix	Example from the doc, modified 
					with polynomial
					(on the parameters) coefficients,
					but with only one parameter to 
					test lex-order in coeff..

test3Deg3Var.matrix			Test with polynomial of degree 3, 
					3 variables.

testDeg3.matrix				Test with polynomial of degree 3.
