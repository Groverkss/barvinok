  Abstract = "We present a plan to add loop nest optimizations in GCC
              based on polyhedral representations of loop nests. We
              advocate a static analysis approach based on a hierarchy
              of interchangeable abstractions with solvers that range
              from the exact solvers such as OMEGA, to faster but less
              precise solvers based on more coarse abstractions. The
              intermediate representation GRAPHITE (GIMPLE Represented
              as Polyhedra with Interchangeable Envelopes), built on
              GIMPLE and the natural loops, hosts the high level loop
              transformations. We base this presentation on the
              WRaP-IT project developed in the Alchemy group at INRIA
              Futurs and Paris-Sud University, on the PIPS compiler
              developed at \'Ecole des mines de Paris, and on a joint
              work with several members of the static analysis and
              polyhedral compilation community in France.

              The main goal of this project is to bring more high
              level loop optimizations to GCC: loop fusion, tiling,
              strip mining, etc. Thanks to the WRaP-IT experience, we
              know that the polyhedral analyzes and transformations
              are affordable in a production compiler. A second goal
              of this project is to experiment with compile time
              reduction versus attainable precision when replacing
              operations on polyhedra with faster operations on more
              abstract domains. However, the use of a too coarse
              representation for computing might also result in an
              over approximated solution that cannot be used in
              subsequent computations. There exists a trade off
              between speed of the computation and the attainable
              precision that has not yet been analyzed for real world
              programs."
